# Music Releases
This was a project I did while attending Technigos 24 week frontend bootcamp. It was a pair programming assignment and the task was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem

We followed the instruction films and code along provided. Had problem at first understanding the concept of react and how to put it together.
